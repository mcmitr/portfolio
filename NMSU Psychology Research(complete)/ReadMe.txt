The Project in this folder was designed for use by the New Mexico State University Psychology Department. 
It consists of a series of matrices that expect certain codes to be typed into the cells after the corresponding math answer cell
is clicked on. The cosed can be found under CritMat for critical issue matrixes, and under MatrixData for normal matrices. It features
a number of text files that are used to make changes to the flavor text, matrix codes, and matrix colors. 

The program also keeps track of the number of errors for each participant, and the total time it took them to complete
the program. These values are stored in results.txt.
